### Version 0.8 of the Aestimo solver has been released!

*2013-07-07 11:06, by Dr. S B. Lisesivdin*

The Aestimo Team is proud to release version 0.8 of Aestimo 1D Self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson Solver. This version includes many new features, bug fixes, and small corrections. The most important feature, which has been added to Aestimo recently, is the implementation of strain-included valence band calculation with a 3×3 k.p model. Also, the Numpy version is restructured, the input file structure and sample inputs are changed and the non-parabolicity of the conduction band is implemented (Numpy version only). In addition, the database is changed to a more clear-understandable structure, and exchange interaction potential is implemented (Numpy version only). Logging with timers, some customizations in the config, and the possibility of looping the simulation over a parameter are also the added to new version. Aestimo can work now with new materials InAs, InP, AlP, GaP, and new alloys InGaAs, InGaP, and AlInP in addition to GaAs and AlGaAs.

Version 0.8 can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/sblisesivdin/aestimo/downloads Aestimo is GPL licensed software. We are always open to your contributions. Please use it, issue a bug, help to write use a better user’s manual, or commit to source!
